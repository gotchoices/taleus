# env-defaults.sh — per-project, override-friendly emulator/Metro/device settings.
#
# The same file is carried by ser/chat, ser/health and ser/taleus; keep the copies
# identical except for the marked PROJECT-SPECIFIC section, so a fix made in one
# can be copied to the others wholesale. See the README's "Devices and ports".
#
# SOURCE this (don't execute it) so the vars carry into the calling shell —
# the package.json scripts do exactly that, e.g.:
#     . ./env-defaults.sh && react-native start --port "$METRO_PORT"
#
# Precedence, lowest to highest:
#   1. the defaults below                   — applied only when the var is unset/empty
#   2. .env.ports.local at the project root — git-ignored; this bench's real settings
#   3. TARGET_* on the command line         — a deliberate one-off, see below
#
# The defaults are the stock React Native / Android ones, so a fresh clone on any
# bench just works. Running this project alongside a sibling is what
# .env.ports.local is for — put the divergent ports there, not here.
#
# When choosing an emulator port: the console port must be EVEN and in 5554..5682;
# the odd port right above it is the paired adb port (so emulator-5554 speaks adb
# on 5555). 5555 is therefore not a legal console port — step by twos.
#
# WHY NOT "anything already exported wins".  That was once the rule, until it caused
# a genuinely confusing failure: a terminal that had sourced this file BEFORE
# .env.ports.local changed still had the old METRO_PORT exported, so `yarn start` in
# that terminal silently bound the OLD port while every other tool used the new one.
# The app then could not find Metro, and nothing said why.  A shell cannot tell a
# deliberate `METRO_PORT=… yarn …` from a stale leftover — they are the same thing —
# so the override moved to names nothing ever exports by accident.

# ANDROID_SERIAL pins every adb and Gradle operation to ONE device.
#
# This is load-bearing, not a convenience. `react-native run-android` shells out to
# Gradle's `app:installDebug`, and that task installs to EVERY connected device --
# the CLI's own --deviceId flag is not passed through to it. So with phones on the
# cable and other projects' emulators up, an unpinned `yarn android` installs on all
# of them, and the whole build fails if ANY one is out of space or still booting.
# adb honors this variable too, so the launch/logs-style scripts inherit it.
#
# Gradle also accepts a comma-separated list here, which is how scripts/android.sh
# targets a multi-device DEVICES set — but only for its own Gradle run. adb rejects
# a list, so the exported value stays a single serial.
