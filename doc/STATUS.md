## Document Review and Issues Found

### Accuracy Assessment of AI-Generated Files

**README.md**: ‚úÖ Accurate
- Correctly reflects the shared database model choice from PROJECT.md
- Accurately describes the libp2p stack (Taleus -> Quereus -> Optimystic -> Kademlia -> libp2p)
- Properly references the 50/50 voting power concept

**doc/architecture.md**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mostly accurate but needs updates
- Correctly describes shared database model
- Contains some outdated references to "message-based model" comparisons that should be simplified
- Missing details about stock/foil nomenclature preference from PROJECT.md
- Missing specific details about tally record types

**doc/protocol.md**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Mostly accurate but needs updates
- Correctly describes shared database protocol
- Still contains message-based protocol references that should be removed/simplified
- Missing detailed record type specifications from PROJECT.md
- Needs more detail on the specific SQL operations

**doc/tally.md**: ‚úÖ Mostly accurate
- Correctly captures most tally record types from Brainstorm.md
- Accurately describes party roles (stock/foil vs party1/party2 choice)
- Missing some specific details about chit digest format
- Good coverage of security considerations

**doc/messages.md**: ‚ùå OBSOLETE
- This file is obsolete given the shared database model choice
- Should be removed or completely rewritten to focus on database operations
- Currently confusing as it presents message-based as still under consideration

### AI Hallucinations and Unreasonable Extrapolations Identified

1. **doc/architecture.md**: 
   - References to "Byzantine fault tolerance at the database level" - this is not specifically mentioned in Brainstorm.md
   - Overly detailed consensus mechanism descriptions not grounded in the source material

2. **doc/protocol.md**:
   - Detailed "Route Discovery and Lifts" section - while lifts are mentioned, this level of detail wasn't specified
   - Some protocol versioning details that weren't requested

3. **doc/messages.md**:
   - Entire hybrid approach section is speculative
   - Message format details that contradict the shared database model choice

### Reference Resources

**MyCHIPs Repository**: https://github.com/gotchoices/MyCHIPs
- Schema definitions: `mychips/schema/tallies.wmt` (trading variables definitions)
- Original implementation patterns and data structures
- Protocol message examples and state transitions

### Missing Implementation Details Needed

Based on PROJECT.md, the following information needs clarification:

## Critical Questions for Implementation

### Schema Design Questions
1. **Record Storage Model**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Use mostly normalized SQL schema with JSON fields where flexibility is needed

2. **Tally ID Generation**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Tally UUID generated as hash of complete Tally Identity Chunk content (protocol version, timestamp, party IDs, master keys)

3. **Stock/Foil Nomenclature**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Use stock/foil nomenclature (maintains compatibility with MyCHIPs)

### Identity and Key Management Questions
4. **SSI Implementation**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - did:key method recommended for SSI layer on top of libp2p
   - [x] Research SSI frameworks (did:key, did:ethr, did:ion, Hyperledger Indy) for hierarchical key derivation
   - [x] Clarify libp2p role as networking layer (not SSI alternative)
   - [x] Determine optimal SSI framework for master key + derived key validation
   - [x] Define key validation requirements for offline/distributed operation
   - [x] Comprehensive SSI framework analysis documented in doc/design/SSI.md

5. **Device Vault vs Exportable Keys**: üîÑ **RESEARCH NEEDED** - Need to evaluate options as part of overall key management strategy.

6. **Master Key Architecture**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Master key system fully designed
   - [x] Define master key disclosure in Tally Identity Chunk
   - [x] Design Key Issuance Chunk for derived key management
   - [x] Specify key validation process (prove derivation from master)
   - [x] Define Tally Configuration Signature Block for chunk operability
   - [x] Merge Party Identity contact info into Party Certificate Chunk

6. **Multi-Key Registration**: How do we implement the ability to register multiple keys/seeds on a tally for recovery purposes?

7. **libp2p PeerID vs SSI**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Party ID is libp2p peerID (hash of master key), maintains compatibility with libp2p while enabling key validation

### Protocol Implementation Questions
8. **Consensus Rule Implementation**: How exactly should the 50/50 voting power be implemented? What happens when nodes disagree?

9. **Local Record Storage**: What records should parties store locally for dispute resolution in addition to the shared database?

10. **Chit Digest Format**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Chit digest format specified: tally ID, party indicator, date, memo, reference, units

### Contract and Negotiation Questions
11. **Contract Format**: Should contracts be PDFs or structured documents (YAML/JSON)? How do we handle content-addressable references?

12. **Negotiation Flow**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Chunk-based negotiation with Tally Configuration Signature Blocks for atomic agreement

13. **Bootstrap Token System**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Message-based bootstrap with one-time and multi-use invitation tokens

### Technical Stack Questions
14. **Quereus Integration**: What specific SQL operations will Quereus need to support? Do we need custom query types?

15. **Optimystic Configuration**: What optimistic database settings are appropriate for tally operations?

16. **Bootstrap and Discovery**: ‚úÖ **PROTOTYPE COMPLETED** ‚Äî Method 6 (Role-Based Link Handshake) implemented and tested. Sequential handler prototype validates design; production state machine implementation required for robustness
