# TLA+ Modeling Analysis for Taleus Tally Negotiation

This document analyzes the Taleus tally negotiation system from a TLA+ formal specification perspective, identifying state variables, actions, and requirements for creating comprehensive formal models.

## TLA+ Conceptual Overview

TLA+ (Temporal Logic of Actions) is a formal specification language for modeling concurrent and distributed systems. Rather than enumerating all possible states, TLA+ describes:

- **State Variables**: The "digits" or variables that can change over time
- **Actions**: State transition rules that define how variables mutate
- **Invariants**: Properties that must always hold in every reachable state
- **Temporal Properties**: Properties about sequences of states (what must eventually happen)

TLA+ specifications enable model checking to verify system correctness and discover subtle bugs in concurrent protocols.

## Analysis of Current Tally Design

### ✅ State Variables Identified from tally.md

Based on the current tally specification, we can identify these key state variables:

```tla
VARIABLES
  \* Bootstrap Process State
  bootstrap_state,     \* {InvitationAvailable, ContactEstablished, ValidationComplete, 
                      \*  DatabaseInstantiated, ClusterFormed, NegotiationActive}
  invitation_tokens,   \* [token_id -> {type, expiration, used, initiator}]
  active_contacts,     \* [contact_id -> {respondent, token, status, timestamp}]
  
  \* Tally Lifecycle State  
  tally_state,         \* {Draft, Offered, Open, Closing, Closed, Void}
  tally_balance,       \* Integer representing current balance
  
  \* Chunk Management
  chunks,              \* [tally_id -> [chunk_type -> [revision -> chunk_data]]]
  chunk_signatures,    \* [chunk_id -> [party -> signature_status]]
  chunk_status,        \* [chunk_id -> {draft, referenced_in_config, superseded}]
  
  \* Configuration Management
  configurations,      \* [config_rev -> {chunk_references, proposer, timestamp}]
  config_signatures,   \* [config_rev -> [party -> signature_status]]
  active_config,       \* Current operative configuration reference
  
  \* Database and Consensus
  database_state,      \* Database cluster status and consensus state
  pending_operations,  \* Queue of database operations awaiting consensus
  node_cluster         \* [party -> node_list] - which nodes each party contributes
```

### 🔄 Key Actions Identified

From the tally specification, these are the primary state transitions:

**Bootstrap Actions:**
- `CreateInvitation(initiator, token_type, expiration)` - Create invitation token
- `InitialContact(respondent, token, credentials)` - Respondent contacts initiator
- `ValidateContact(initiator, contact_id, decision)` - Accept/reject respondent
- `InstantiateDatabase(initiator, contact_id)` - Create shared database
- `GrantAccess(initiator, respondent, credentials)` - Give database access
- `FormCluster(tally_id, nodes)` - Establish 50/50 consensus cluster

**Chunk Management Actions:**
- `ProposeChunk(party, tally_id, chunk_type, content)` - Create new chunk revision
- `SignChunk(party, chunk_id)` - Sign a chunk (where required)
- `ReviseChunk(party, chunk_id, new_content)` - Create new revision

**Configuration Actions:**
- `ProposeConfiguration(party, tally_id, chunk_refs)` - Propose operative chunk set
- `SignConfiguration(party, config_rev)` - Sign configuration proposal
- `ActivateConfiguration(config_rev)` - Make configuration operative when both signed
- `SupersedeConfiguration(new_config_rev)` - Replace active configuration

**Operational Actions:**
- `CreateChit(party, tally_id, amount, memo)` - Record transaction
- `RequestClose(party, tally_id)` - Request tally closure
- `ProcessLift(tally_id, amount)` - Process credit lift operation

### ❌ Critical Gaps in Current Specification

## Missing Information for TLA+ Modeling

### 1. Database Consensus Semantics ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**❓ Questions Needing Answers:**
- [ ] **Consensus Algorithm**: What specific consensus algorithm implements the "50/50" voting?
- [ ] **Operation Ordering**: How are concurrent database writes ordered and resolved?
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: What happens when both parties submit conflicting operations simultaneously?
- [ ] **Atomicity**: Are chunk creation and signing atomic operations?
- [ ] **Rollback Capability**: Can database operations be rolled back? Under what conditions?
- [ ] **Partition Tolerance**: How does the system behave during network partitions?

**🎯 Modeling Impact:**
Without these details, we cannot accurately model the core consensus mechanism that ensures tally consistency.

### 2. Concurrency Control ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**❓ Questions Needing Answers:**
- [ ] **Simultaneous Proposals**: Can both parties propose configurations simultaneously?
- [ ] **Race Conditions**: What happens if Party A signs Config Rev 1 while Party B proposes Config Rev 2?
- [ ] **Chunk Dependencies**: Can chunks reference each other? Are there ordering constraints?
- [ ] **Signature Timing**: Is there a time window for collecting both signatures on configurations?
- [ ] **Competing Configurations**: How are multiple pending configuration proposals handled?
- [ ] **Chunk Retraction**: Can proposed chunks be withdrawn before being referenced?

**🎯 Modeling Impact:**
Concurrency bugs are among the most critical in distributed systems and must be explicitly modeled.

### 3. Failure and Recovery Scenarios ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**

**❓ Questions Needing Answers:**
- [ ] **Network Partitions**: How does negotiation proceed when parties can't communicate?
- [ ] **Node Failures**: What happens if database nodes fail during active negotiation?
- [ ] **Timeout Behaviors**: Are there timeouts for signature collection, chunk proposals?
- [ ] **Recovery Protocols**: How do parties resynchronize after failures?
- [ ] **Partial Signatures**: What happens if only one party signs a configuration?
- [ ] **Database Corruption**: How is database integrity verified and maintained?

**🎯 Modeling Impact:**
Failure scenarios often reveal the most subtle correctness issues in distributed protocols.

### 4. State Consistency and Validation ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**❓ Questions Needing Answers:**
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: Beyond required chunks, what makes a configuration "valid"?
- [ ] **Chunk Content Constraints**: Are there semantic relationships between chunk contents?
- [ ] **Version Compatibility**: Can old chunk revisions be mixed with new ones arbitrarily?
- [ ] **Identity Consistency**: How is party identity maintained across key rotations?
- [ ] **Balance Constraints**: What validates chit amounts and balance calculations?
- [ ] **Contract Enforcement**: How are contract terms validated against chunk contents?

**🎯 Modeling Impact:**
State consistency rules define the invariants that must be maintained throughout system operation.
