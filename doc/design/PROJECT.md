Project Objectives (human generated, maintained)

- Taleus will be built on libp2p.  Specifically, the stack is:
  - Taleus -> Quereus -> Optimystic -> Kademlia -> libp2p

- A tally is a private ledger and contract between two parties.
- Tallies contain several types of records
  - Tally ID:
    - Somehow, we need a universally unique ID for the tally so all other records can be relational to it.
    - Current thinking is to establish this as a hash of data that includes both parties' ID's, the tally creation date and possibly other immutable data..
  - Party ID and keys: 
    - Each of the parties needs to have an ID recorded on the tally.
    - The parties must be distinctly identified.  It would be nice to keep the historical stock/foil nomenclature from MyCHIPs (party A is stock, party B is foil).
    - Whoever first builds the tally database will record their ID first and become stock.
    - The other party will become foil.
    - The party ID is a hash of the public key by which the party signs transactions.  This may be libp2p compliant by may not necessarily be so.
    - Ideally, the party ID will related to a "genesis key" (such as in self-sovereign keys) from which a progeny sequence of keys will originate.
    - Open question: Will keys be generated inside a secure vault?
      - If so, we have no way to export them and move them to another device.
      - Can new SSI keys be generated from a private key that is inside a vault?
  - Cadre ID's
    - Each party supplies a list of (libp2p) peer IDs.
    - The tally is hosted by the set of all nodes supplied by both parties.
    - The parties should be able to amend this set by appending new records.
  - Identity Certificate
    - Each party should disclose to the other a set of identifying information collectively referred to as the party's certificate.
    - This should be substantially the same as legacy MyCHIPs and includes things such as:
      - All names the person has been known by
      - Communication points (phone, pager, email, web, etc)
      - Addresses (home, mailing, shipping, etc)
      - Files (images, scans, documents).  These might be content addresses (like ipfs).
      - Key(s) perhaps public key info belongs in the certificate
    - Certficates should be signed by the party they represent (certifying a representation/disclosure) to the other party.
  - Credit offering
    - This represents the credit limit, call term, and possibly other terms one party extends to the other.
    - It must be signed by the party offering/extending the terms.
    - An new record (amendment) can be logged to the tally at any time.
    - But if it represents a restriction, it will only take effect after the call term (in days) has expired.
  - Contract
    - This record references a governing document which is the agreement between the parties
    - It must be signed (representing acceptance) by both parties to be in force
    - This will typically be an IPFS or similar content-based address/reference
    - The nodes that host the tally will be duty-bound to host/cache any such documents referenced by the tallies they handle.
    - A new contract record can be logged at any time by either party.  It becomes operative when signed by the other party.
    - The format of the document must be understood by the system and/or the parties.  Presumably this could just be a PDF document.  But there are some advantages to the structured document format used in the original MyCHIPs as it is nearly all content (and no formatting) and so makes it easier to understand what is being hashed (to assure that two different documents are distinct and not just a differently formatted/presented version of the same thing).
  - Trading Variables
    - This record contains four variables that instruct automated agents how to perform credit lifts on behalf of the party.
    - This record is signed by only one party to signify how to treat trades from his perspective of the tally.
    - The file mychips/schema/tallies.wmt contains definitions for these values.
      - bound: The upper limit of credit that may be produced by any lift.
      - target: The ideal balance to be reached by lifting.
      - margin: An amount to charge for lifts exceeding target.
      - clutch: An amount to charge for lifts in the reverse direction (drops).
  - Chit
    - A chit is a pledge for a certain number of CHIPs (the unit of measure for value).
    - A positive amount represents a pledge of value from foil to stock. A negative number implies a pledge from stock to foil.
    - The chit is signed by the party making the pledge.
    - The signature digest consists of the following serialized fields:
      - ID of the tally the chit belongs to.
      - Which party is issuing the pledge (s or f).
      - Date of the pledge (format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ in UTC).
      - Memo (human readable comment).
      - Reference (machine readable json).
      - Units (integer number of milliCHIPs as a positive number).
    - A tally maintains a total balance which is the net sum of all valid chits.
  - Chit Request
    - This requests a certain number of CHIPs from the other party.
    - It should be signed by the party requesting the payment.
    - The other party should read it, process it, and then create a chit in response to it.
  - Close Request
    - Either party can register a record requesting the tally to close.
    - The record must be signed by the requesting party.
    - The tally will remain open until its balance reaches zero, at which point it is closed.
    - Zero balance can be achieved throught lifts or manual chits.
    - A tally marked as closing should only accept chits that move it closer to zero.
- Tally records can stand on their own in terms of their validity (cryptographic signatures).  However each record needs to be linked back to the tally ID so they can be understood in context.
- In the event of a corrupt partner (who somehow tries to delete or hide records), it is up to the other partner to maintain posession of all records that protect his position (for example, signed pledges from the other party).  A complete tally is the collection of all duly signed records that reference the tally ID.  The parties might end up in court presenting 'their version' of the tally, but the legally binding tally is the set of all valid records produced by the parties.
- Negotiation sequence:  Part of the design will be to validate the sequence of states that can occur when two parties negotiate a tally.  The steps are roughly as follows:
  - Party A creates some kind of unique token it will recognize.  Tokens can be generated for one-time use or for multiple use.  Tokens are also associated with a tally template--a draft of the tally terms the party will offer.
  - Party A then communicates an offer to Party B, which offer includes the token and certain data A will add to the tally.
  - Party B contacts A, dislosing the token, along with its own data.
  - When a party is in possession of enough information to determine that a tally is feasible, it can create a new libp2p network, kademlia and database.
  - The creating party writes the draft tally to the database along with any modifications it wants.  It then signs the tally.
  - This constitutes a binding offer to the other party who can then sign, modify or reject the offer.
  - When a given record type is entered/modified multiple times, each record has a unique, sequential revision.
  - Negotiation is complete when a complete set of records of a given revision have been signed by both parties.  If multiple such sets are identified, the set with the highest revision number prevails.

Questions/Observations
- Original model
  - In the original MyCHIPs, each party was responsible for keeping a separate record of its half of the tally.
  - This required some kind of consensus algorithm to help the two parties keep their copies of the ledger consistent.
  - Parties to the tally were identified by the historical tags 'stock holder' and 'foil holder'
  - So one party's copy of the tally was 'the stock' and the other party held 'the foil'
  - Tally negotiation and Synchronization was accomplished by a protocol of messages sent back and forth between the parties.
- Shared database model
  - Taleus is oriented around a model where:
    - Each party will propose a set of libp2p nodes to participate in management of the tally.
    - The resulting set of nodes will establish a common network.
    - A kademlia database will established on the network.
    - Optimystic implements an optimistic database model atop kademlia.
    - Quereus implements a query parser on top of Optimystic.
    - The parties will communicate with each other by writing records to the common SQL database.
  - Question: is this model preferable to the split tally (message-protocol) model?
- Tally balance sign
  - In the original MyCHIPs, parties would think of net positive pledges to themselves as an asset (positive number) and net pledges to the other party as a liability (negative number).
  - But if the tally were ever represented externally, it would use a more objective measure.  Specifically, a positive tally balance represents value owed by the foil holder to the stock holder.
  - Going to the shared database model, can we keep the stock/foil references if, for no other reason, to keep track of what a positive or negative number means?
- Libp2p peerID's vs SSI identities
  - How do cycled keys work in SSI?
  - Can we create a libp2p peer id based on the original SSI seed, as opposed to the 'current public key'?
  - Are there alternatives to SSI that might work better?
- Schema
  - The original MyCHIPs implementation stored tallies as follows:
    - Tally header (contained party identification, contract, initial terms).
    - Chits (originally meant for payments only but settings and trading variables were wedged into the same table later).
    - Chits were stored in a hash-chain so as to more easily verify consenus (by comparing end of chain index and hash).
  - With a shared database model, we likely do not need to keep a hash chain.
    - However, consider the byzantine case where one party has more nodes than the other and
      purposely throws away certain records in order to gain advantage.
    - In this case, even though the parties operate on a shared database, individual parties will need a way to locally store valuable records the other party refuses to acknowledge/store so the true tally can be proven before an arbiter or court.
    - Can we employ a consensus rule where each party nominates certain nodes to be part of the network?
    - The nodes that represent party A get 50% of the vote (regardless of their number) and party B's nodes also get 50% of the vote.
    - In this way, either consensus is reached (both parties agree) or the parties disagree.  If they disagree, it is up to the humans to work out their differences in court or arbitration by producing cryptographic records and proving the accurate tally balance and terms.
  - What would an SQL schema look like to contain a full tally?
    - We will build an example schema to explore this
- Standard
  - The objective of this library is to establish the standard by which all MyCHIPs-compliant PCN nodes operate.
  - In the case of a message-based protocol (like the original MyCHIPs), the standard was in the message packets themselves.  It was up to the implementation to store state appropriately.
  - In the case of this new shared-database model (Taleus), it seems the libary itself will become the standard (or at least the SQL schema).
