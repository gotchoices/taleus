# Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Framework Analysis for Taleus

This document analyzes SSI frameworks for integration with Taleus's libp2p-based tally management system.

## Executive Summary

Based on research into available SSI frameworks, **did:key** emerges as the most suitable choice for Taleus, providing a lightweight, offline-capable SSI system that integrates well with our libp2p networking stack. While we could build a custom system, did:key offers standardized SSI capabilities without blockchain dependencies.

## Architecture Context

**libp2p is our networking foundation** - this analysis is about which SSI framework to layer on top of libp2p for:
- Identity management and verification
- Master key derivation and key rotation
- Verifiable credential capabilities  
- Standards-compliant SSI operations

The SSI system will work alongside libp2p PeerIDs, where the PeerID provides network identity and the SSI system provides self-sovereign identity management.

## Requirements Analysis

For Taleus, we need an SSI system that provides:

1. **Open source, open design** - No vendor lock-in, transparent implementation
2. **Master key with hierarchical derivation** - One root key generating all subsequent keys
3. **Derived key validation** - Ability to cryptographically prove key derivation
4. **libp2p integration** - Compatible with libp2p networking (PeerID can be derived from SSI master key)
5. **React Native support** - Mobile app development capability
6. **Offline operation** - No dependency on external networks or blockchain services
7. **Lightweight implementation** - Minimal overhead for tally operations
8. **Verifiable credentials** - Support for issuing/verifying credentials between tally parties
9. **Standard compliance** - Compatible with W3C DID/VC specifications

## SSI Framework Comparison

### 1. did:key Method ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

**Overview**: W3C DID method that derives DIDs directly from cryptographic keys without requiring external registries.

**Key Features**:
- **Registry-free**: DIDs derived directly from public keys using standardized transformations

- **Self-contained**: No external dependencies or network requirements

**Hierarchical Key Support**:
- ‚úÖ **Master key architecture**: Can implement BIP32/BIP44 HD derivation  
- ‚úÖ **Key derivation proofs**: Each derived key can prove its lineage cryptographically
- ‚úÖ **Key rotation**: Generate new DIDs from derived keys while maintaining provable connection to master
- ‚úÖ **libp2p integration**: PeerID can be derived from same master key as DID

**Verifiable Credentials**:

- Lightweight crypto operations

**libp2p Integration Pattern**:
```javascript
// Master key generates both DID and PeerID
const masterSeed = generateMnemonic()
const masterKeyPair = deriveMasterKey(masterSeed)

// Generate DID for SSI operations
const did = generateDIDKey(masterKeyPair.publicKey)

// Generate PeerID for libp2p networking  
const peerID = generatePeerID(masterKeyPair.publicKey)

// Both share same master key lineage
assert(verifyCommonLineage(did, peerID, masterKeyPair))
```

### 2. Hyperledger Indy/AnonCreds ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT RECOMMENDED**

## Recommended Architecture: did:key + libp2p

### Identity Architecture
```javascript
// Master seed generates all identity material
const masterSeed = generateMnemonic() // BIP39 mnemonic for backup
const masterKeyPair = deriveMasterKey(masterSeed, "m/44'/0'/0'") // BIP32 derivation

// SSI identity (for credentials, signatures, tally identity)
const didDocument = {
  id: generateDIDKey(masterKeyPair.publicKey), // did:key:z6Mk...
  verificationMethod: [{
    id: '#key-1',
    type: 'Ed25519VerificationKey2020',
    publicKeyMultibase: encodeKey(masterKeyPair.publicKey)
  }]
}

// Network identity (for libp2p networking)
const peerID = generatePeerID(masterKeyPair.publicKey) // 12D3KooW...

// Operational keys (derived from master, used for day-to-day operations)
const operationalKey = deriveKey(masterSeed, "m/44'/0'/0'/0/0")
const operationalDID = generateDIDKey(operationalKey.publicKey)
```

### Integration Benefits
1. **Unified identity lineage** - Both DID and PeerID derive from same master key
2. **Standards compliance** - Full W3C DID/VC compatibility  
3. **Network optimization** - libp2p handles networking, DID handles identity
4. **Offline operation** - No external dependencies for core operations
5. **Mobile-friendly** - Pure JavaScript, lightweight implementation

### Tally Use Cases
```javascript
// Issue tally certificate as Verifiable Credential
const tallyCertificate = {
  '@context': ['https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1'],
  type: ['VerifiableCredential', 'TallyCertificate'],
  issuer: stockHolderDID,
  credentialSubject: {
    id: foilHolderDID,
    tallyID: 'tally-uuid-123',
    creditLimit: 10000,
    contractReference: 'ipfs://Qm...'
  },
  proof: signWithDID(stockHolderDID, certificateData)
}

// Verify certificate offline
const isValid = verifyVC(tallyCertificate, stockHolderDID)
```
